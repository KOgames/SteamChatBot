This is a WIP of a C#/.NET port of [node-steam-chat-bot](https://github.com/Steam-Chat-Bot/node-steam-chat-bot).

Credits to Jessecar96 for the custom logger used in his steambot, found [here](https://github.com/jessecar96/steambot).
Note: If you want to build the InstallSteamChatBot project in vs (it's the one that packages the installer file), you need to download [an addon](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1cc3f3e-c300-40a7-8797-c509fb8933b9) for visual studio.

** Update February 28, 2016 **: I would like to say that I am almost done with this project. The main bot code is done, now all that's left really is to just add triggers and make it better.
	
** Update May 27, 2016 **: First release of SteamChatBot. When you run the application, a pop up will (most likely) appear saying something along the lines of "Windows smartscreen protected your PC". This is because I don't have the applation signed because it costs a lot of money. Just press "more info" and then "Run anyways" when that pops up.
