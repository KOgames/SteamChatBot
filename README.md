This is a WIP of a C#/.NET port of [node-steam-chat-bot](https://github.com/efreak/node-steam-chat-bot).

[s]This project is going to be as close of a port as I can get to the original. The development process is going to be rather slow probably, but once it's done it'll be worth the wait.[/s]


Credits to Jessecar96 for the custom logger used in his steambot, found [here](https://github.com/jessecar96/steambot).

Update February 28, 2016:
	I would like to say that I am almost done with this project. The main bot code is done, now all that's left really is to just add triggers and make it better.
