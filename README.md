This is a WIP of a C#/.NET port of [node-steam-chat-bot](https://github.com/Steam-Chat-Bot/node-steam-chat-bot).

Credits to Jessecar96 for the custom logger used in his steambot, found [here](https://github.com/jessecar96/steambot).

Update February 28, 2016:
	I would like to say that I am almost done with this project. The main bot code is done, now all that's left really is to just add triggers and make it better.
